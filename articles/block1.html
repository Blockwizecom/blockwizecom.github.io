        BITCOIN is the result of thinking differently. Satoshi Nakamoto's idea
        laid the groundwork for what's now a billion dollar industry.

        Bitcoin is a store of value, a currency allowing you to transact all 
        over the globe... securely, quickly, cheaply and permits one to be 
        their own bank. Okay okay... so why am i saying you shouldn't put a 
        cent into it? Actually what i mean is bitcoin deserves more than a 
        cent from you, this new tech is a big experiment thats made a lot of
        people start to look closer and question the current financial 
        system. 

        An experiment? yes i like to think of bitcoin sort of like
        a rent to buy on a car if we keep pulling through for bitcoin we will
        own something really big. So as much as there's this big vision of
        owning this really big Valuable bitcoin market bitcoin is already here
        and able to drive us daily, remittances, making payments for online 
        services safer and quicker there's a lot more we could embrace bitcoin
        for and those possibilities will become a reality as more people enter 
        the bitcoin space making more merchants start accepting bitcoin.

        You don't have to sell your house okay but do try put a couple of
        10's and 100's into bitcoin and when you get opportunities to pay with
        bitcoin try paying with bitcoin, get used to paying differently.

        Bitcoin gives you freedom to decide what you yourself want do with 
        it or the technology and way of thinking it's brought about.
