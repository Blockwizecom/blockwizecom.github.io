<p> Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that allows applications and smart
    contracts to run continuously as planned eliminating downtime... Okay...
    so is it like bitcoin? Well yes in many ways bitcoin has the first and 
    longest running blockchain and a lot of the properties out find in ethereum 
    originated from bitcoin, that said though ethereum has some major differences
    and additions that expand on what bitcoin was created to do. Lets dig into
    ethereum and find out exactly what it is and how it runs.

     Russian born Vitalik Buterin is the originator of the idea of ethereum which 
     he put on a "white paper" Him, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles 
     Hoskinson where the core ethereum team. The project was crowd-funded in mid 
     2014 raising millions for the project. So ethereum like bitcoin has a 
     blockchain and there are millions of mining machines maintaining that 
     blockchain miners earn ether as a reward for maintaining the ethereum 
     blockchain and enabling the smart contracts to keep running. 

<p>  Ether is the currency of ethereum also known as gas because it is used to fuel
     or pay for use of the ethereum blockchain for applications and smart contracts, 
     the ethereum token is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges with the symbol ETH. 
     The supply of Ether was projected to increase by 14.75% in 2017, with an algorithm
     in place to gradually decline to 1.59% by 2065(wikipedia) making the supply of
     ether tokens deflationary.  
</p>  
       
<p>  Onto smart contracts. Let's use an example, say a person purchases an option on
     the price of oil that it will be higher at a specified date than its current price,
     meaning if they are right they earn interest and if they turn out wrong they loose
     money, all the conditions and terms are put into a smart contract and the smart 
     contract will execute as per the outcome on the set expiry date.
