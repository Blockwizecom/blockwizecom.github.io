<p> Having a currency on a blockchain in todays world is beneficial in several ways. </p>

<p> Its transparent and open source, anyone can review its code to understand it and verify its security
and inner workings </p>

<p> There is a limit to how many can ever exist, this helps curb possible hyperinflation due to printing
new money </p>

<p> No one needs to apply anywhere or ask anyone for permission to open up a bitcoin wallet</p>

<p> Bitcoin is quick and easy to send and receive around the world </p>

<p> <h2> How bitcoin and blockchain work in the background </h2>
   Blockchain i a network made up of millions of individual computers around the world the somputers are
   called MINERS mminers are connected via the internet to form the blockchain, they maintain a ledgar 
   which keeps track of which wallets have bitcoins thus when bitcoins are sent from one wallet to another
   they are responsible for adjusting the ledgar and verifying the transaction.</p>

   <p> miners are in different locaations all over the globe and this makes the network decentralized.
   miners do a very important job and thus when they solve a block of transactions they are rewarded with
   new bitcoins, this is how new bitcoins are introduced and distributed until all 21 million bitcoins 
   have been mined. Miners also earn money from transaction fees that are in each transaction users make 
   on the blockchain.</p>
